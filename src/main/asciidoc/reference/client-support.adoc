= Client support

Spring Vault supports a various HTTP clients to access Vault's HTTP API. Spring Vault uses
http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/html/remoting.html#rest-resttemplate[`RestTemplate`] as primary interface accessing Vault.
Dedicated client support originates from <<vault.client-ssl,customized SSL configuration>>
that is scoped only to Spring Vault's client components.

Spring Vault supports following HTTP clients:

* Java's builtin `HttpURLConnection` (default client)
* Apache Http Components
* Netty
* OkHttp 2
* OkHttp 3

Using a specific client requires the according dependency to be available on the classpath
so Spring Vault can use the available client for communicating with Vault.

== Java's builtin `HttpURLConnection`

Java's builtin `HttpURLConnection` is available out-of-the-box without additional
configuration. Using `HttpURLConnection` comes with a limitation regarding SSL configuration.
Spring Vault won't apply <<vault.client-ssl,customized SSL configuration>> as it would
require a deep reconfiguration of the JVM. This configuration would affect all
components relying on the default SSL context. Configuring SSL settings using
`HttpURLConnection` requires you providing these settings as System Properties. See
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#InstallationAndCustomization[Customizing JSSE] for further details.

== External Clients
You can use external clients to access Vault's API. Simply add one of the following
dependencies to your project. You can omit the version number if using
<<dependencies,Spring Vault's Dependency BOM>>
