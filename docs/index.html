{% capture billboard_description %}

Spring Vault provides familiar Spring abstractions and client-side support for accessing, storing and revoking secrets. It offers both low-level and
high-level abstractions for interacting with Vault, freeing the user from infrastructural concerns.

With [HashiCorp's Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io) you have a central place to manage external secret data for applications across all environments.
Vault can manage static and dynamic secrets such as application data, username/password for remote applications/resources and provide credentials for external services such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Apache Cassandra, Consul, AWS and more.

## Features

* Connection package as low-level abstraction
* Reading, writing and deleting data from Vault with object mapping support
* Multiple authentication mechanisms: AppId, AppRole, Client Certificates, and Cubbyhole (wrapped/stored token)

## Quick Start

{% include download_widget.md %}

#### Configure VaultTemplate

```java
@Configuration
class VaultConfiguration extends AbstractVaultConfiguration {

  @Override
  public VaultEndpoint vaultEndpoint() {
    return new VaultEndpoint();
  }

  @Override
  public ClientAuthentication clientAuthentication() {
    return new TokenAuthentication("â€¦");
  }
}
```


#### Inject and use VaultTemplate

```java
public class Example {

  // inject the actual template
  @Autowired
  private VaultOperations operations;

  public void writeSecrets(String userId, String password) {

    Map<String, String> data = new HashMap<String, String>();
    data.put("password", password);

    operations.write(userId, data);
  }

  public Person readSecrets(String userId) {

    VaultResponseSupport<Person> response = operations.read(userId, Person.class);
    return response.getBody();
    }
}
```
